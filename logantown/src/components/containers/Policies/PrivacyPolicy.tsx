      <p className="policy-text  u-h4">
        DO WE USE "COOKIES"? <br />
        <br />
        Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider
        transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you
        allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to
        recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For
        instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in
        your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your
        preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us
        to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us
        compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that
        we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may
        contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better
        understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not
        permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help
        us conduct and improve our business. You can choose to have your
        computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to
        turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape
        Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little
        different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to
        modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to
        many features that make your site experience more efficient and some of
        our services will not function properly. However, you can still place
        orders over the telephone by contacting customer service.
