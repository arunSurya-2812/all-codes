          As mentioned a trend of great concern is manufacturers implying the
          use of fusion materials on boards that are actually made of single
          layer fabric. Some creative layer-counting takes place for the sake of
          advertising, so read construction claims critically. A common practice
          is to count adhesives or coatings as 'layers, which muddies the waters
          quite a bit with regard to the actual composition of the materials
          used.
